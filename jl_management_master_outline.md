### About
**About J&L Management**
> At J&L Management, we believe great community management is built on trust, transparency, and personal connection. Since 2000, we’ve been dedicated to helping homeowners’ associations thrive—providing the expertise, resources, and care needed to keep communities running smoothly.  
> With more than 20 years of experience in property and association management, we’ve seen every challenge an HOA can face—and we know how to handle it. Our founder, Jeni Carrier, began her management career in 1998 and quickly recognized the need for HOA services that go beyond paperwork and policies. That’s why, in 2001, she focused J&L exclusively on community association management, combining deep industry knowledge with a hands-on, responsive approach.  
> Licensed in both Minnesota and Colorado, and certified through the Community Association Institute in the Rocky Mountain and Twin Cities chapters, J&L Management offers a full spectrum of HOA services. From bookkeeping and budget preparation to rule enforcement, maintenance coordination, and large-scale project oversight, we provide tailored solutions that meet each community’s unique needs.  
> What truly sets us apart is our accessibility—you won’t get lost in an automated system or wait days for a response. When you call, Jeni answers. We know your property is more than just an address; it’s your home, your investment, and your community. We’re committed to protecting it as if it were our own.
